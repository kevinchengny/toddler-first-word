<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

The App "Toddler's First Word" was developed using OpenCV to teach toddlers new words by detecting handheld objects Realtime and announcing those words to the toddlers. 

Here's why:
* Tested out OpenCV's integration and my current models
* Created as a my first OpenCV project
* Babies are Energy Monsters. They need Distractions. What better way to get some alone time than to use an App that can teach and fascinate babies at the same time! :smile:

Feel Free to help Commit to this Humble Project where we help families all over the world calm those babies down with the power of EDUCATION!

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With
I plan to use TensorFlow to optimize the model a bit better.
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* opencv - recommended to use a virtual environment
```sh
pip install opencv-python
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/kevinchengny/toddler-first-word.git
```
2. Install OpenCV packages
```sh
pip install opencv-python
```
3. Engage & Give it to the Toddlers!





<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The App works best within 1-2 feet away from the camera. It can auto-detect multiple objects at the same time and detects objects from coco's database (Take a look at coco.names for more words). The program is best ran on a Personal Desktop with a dedicated GPU, however, I plan to optimize the model more and port it over to IOS first!

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://opencv.org/)_



<!-- ROADMAP -->
